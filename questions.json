          "answer": "The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed via the Internet. The Internet, on the other hand, is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standard protocols. In essence, the Internet provides the infrastructure for the WWW to exist and operate.",

          "answer": "In the client-server architecture, clients are devices (such as computers or smartphones) that request services or resources from servers. Servers are computers that provide services or resources to clients. In web development, clients typically refer to web browsers, while servers host websites and serve web pages to clients upon request.",

          "question": "What is HTTP and how does it work?",
          "answer": "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, allowing for the transfer of hypertext documents, such as HTML files. HTTP operates on a client-server model, where clients send requests for resources and servers respond with the requested content.",

          "answer": "The primary HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. GET is used to request data from a specified resource, POST is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource, PUT is used to upload data to a specified resource, DELETE is used to delete a specified resource, and HEAD is used to request headers from a specified resource without transferring the entire content.",

          "answer": "Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side by web browsers. They are used to store information about the user or their interactions with the website, such as login credentials, preferences, shopping cart items, or tracking identifiers. Cookies are sent with each HTTP request to the server and can be read, modified, or deleted by both the client and server.

          "answer": "Web caching is the process of storing copies of web resources such as HTML pages, images, stylesheets, or scripts temporarily on a local device or server. Caching reduces the need to re-fetch resources from the original server, improving the performance and efficiency of web browsing and reducing network traffic. Web caching can occur at different levels, including the browser cache, proxy servers, and content delivery networks (CDNs), and can be controlled using cache-control headers or meta tags in HTTP responses.",

          "answer": "Web standards are guidelines, specifications, and best practices established by standardization organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to ensure interoperability, compatibility, and accessibility of web technologies. Adhering to web standards helps web developers create websites that work consistently across different browsers, devices, and platforms, are accessible to people with disabilities, and are future-proofed against changes in technology or browser updates.",

          "answer": "Website accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of designing and developing websites that can be accessed, understood, and used by people of all abilities, including those with disabilities. It involves following accessibility guidelines and standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers, providing alternative text for images, captions for videos, and semantic HTML markup, and conducting usability testing with diverse user groups. Accessible websites benefit everyone by improving usability, user experience, search engine visibility, and compliance with legal requirements and industry standards.",

          "question": "Describe what happens when you type a URL into a browser and hit ENTER.",
          "answer": "When you type a URL into a browser and hit ENTER, several steps occur behind the scenes to retrieve and display the requested web page. Firstly, the browser parses the URL to identify the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), domain name (such as www.example.com), and optional path or query parameters. Next, it checks its local cache to see if the requested page has been visited recently and if a cached copy exists. If not, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address, allowing it to locate the web server hosting the requested page. Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the web server and sends an HTTP request for the specified resource. The server processes the request, retrieves the requested web page and any associated resources (such as images, stylesheets, or scripts), and sends them back to the browser in an HTTP response. Finally, the browser receives the response, parses the HTML content, renders the web page, and displays it to the user, allowing them to interact with the page's content and functionality.",

          "question": "What is a TCP connection?",
          "answer": "A TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection serves as a reliable communication link between devices on a network, ensuring data exchange with guaranteed delivery. When established, TCP connections facilitate the transfer of information by breaking data into manageable segments, each with its sequence number for ordered transmission. TCP employs error detection and correction mechanisms to maintain data integrity, ensuring that information reaches its destination accurately. Through flow control and congestion avoidance algorithms, TCP regulates data flow to prevent network congestion and optimize transmission rates. In summary, TCP connections play a vital role in enabling efficient and error-free communication between devices over the internet and other networks.",

          "answer": "The box model in CSS describes how elements are rendered on a web page by defining the content area, padding, border, and margin of each element. It consists of four components: content (the actual content of the element), padding (the space between the content and the border), border (the border around the padding), and margin (the space outside the border).",

Block elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and take up the full width available. Inline-block elements are displayed inline but behave like block elements in terms of layout and sizing.",

          "answer": "Relative positioning in CSS positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow, without changing the layout of surrounding elements. Absolute positioning, on the other hand, positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block, completely removing it from the document flow. Relative positioning can be useful for fine-tuning the position of elements within a layout without disrupting the flow of other elements.",

Variables are declared using the var, let, or const keywords, followed by a unique name. These names, also known as identifiers, can consist of letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but cannot start with a digit. Variables can be assigned values using the assignment operator (=).

It represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a tree of objects, where each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or piece of text in the document.

It can select elements using methods such as getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), or querySelector(), and then modify their content, attributes, styles, or event handlers using properties and methods such as innerHTML, className, style, or addEventListener().
