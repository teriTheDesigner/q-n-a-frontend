          "answer": "In the client-server architecture, clients are devices (such as computers or smartphones) that request services or resources from servers. Servers are computers that provide services or resources to clients. In web development, clients typically refer to web browsers, while servers host websites and serve web pages to clients upon request.",

          "question": "What is HTTP and how does it work?",
          "answer": "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, allowing for the transfer of hypertext documents, such as HTML files. HTTP operates on a client-server model, where clients send requests for resources and servers respond with the requested content.",

          "answer": "Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client-side by web browsers. They are used to store information about the user or their interactions with the website, such as login credentials, preferences, shopping cart items, or tracking identifiers. Cookies are sent with each HTTP request to the server and can be read, modified, or deleted by both the client and server. They are commonly used for session management, personalization, and tracking purposes in web development.",

          "answer": "Web caching is the process of storing copies of web resources such as HTML pages, images, stylesheets, or scripts temporarily on a local device or server. Caching reduces the need to re-fetch resources from the original server, improving the performance and efficiency of web browsing and reducing network traffic. Web caching can occur at different levels, including the browser cache, proxy servers, and content delivery networks (CDNs), and can be controlled using cache-control headers or meta tags in HTTP responses.",

          "answer": "Web standards are guidelines, specifications, and best practices established by standardization organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to ensure interoperability, compatibility, and accessibility of web technologies. Adhering to web standards helps web developers create websites that work consistently across different browsers, devices, and platforms, are accessible to people with disabilities, and are future-proofed against changes in technology or browser updates.",

          "question": "Describe what happens when you type a URL into a browser and hit ENTER.",
          "answer": "When you type a URL into a browser and hit ENTER, several steps occur behind the scenes to retrieve and display the requested web page. Firstly, the browser parses the URL to identify the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), domain name (such as www.example.com), and optional path or query parameters. Next, it checks its local cache to see if the requested page has been visited recently and if a cached copy exists. If not, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address, allowing it to locate the web server hosting the requested page. Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a TCP connection with the web server and sends an HTTP request for the specified resource. The server processes the request, retrieves the requested web page and any associated resources (such as images, stylesheets, or scripts), and sends them back to the browser in an HTTP response. Finally, the browser receives the response, parses the HTML content, renders the web page, and displays it to the user, allowing them to interact with the page's content and functionality.",

          "question": "What is a TCP connection?",
          "answer": "A TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection serves as a reliable communication link between devices on a network, ensuring data exchange with guaranteed delivery. When established, TCP connections facilitate the transfer of information by breaking data into manageable segments, each with its sequence number for ordered transmission. TCP employs error detection and correction mechanisms to maintain data integrity, ensuring that information reaches its destination accurately. Through flow control and congestion avoidance algorithms, TCP regulates data flow to prevent network congestion and optimize transmission rates. In summary, TCP connections play a vital role in enabling efficient and error-free communication between devices over the internet and other networks.",
